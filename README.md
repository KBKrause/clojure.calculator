# learn-Clojure

Wanted to get back into Clojure. Since FP is good for computationally heavy applications, I thought I would create a calculator program. It's also good to have at least 1 FP language in your pocket.<br>

I chose Clojure because I used it (minimally) in college. I think it will be easier to pick up than something new like Erlang, Elixir, Scala, etc.

This code follows some sample learning problems I found online. Ultimately, I'd like to create a simple calculator with a GUI. Since it all compiles to Java bytecode, I'm hoping to build the GUI/"front end" in Java and have the logic handled by Clojure. :)

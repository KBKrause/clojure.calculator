# clojure.calculator

Wanted to get back into Clojure. Since FP is good for computationally heavy applications, I thought I would create a calculator program.<br>

I chose Clojure because I used it (minimally) in college. I think it will be easier to pick up than something new like Erlang, Elixir, Scala, etc.
